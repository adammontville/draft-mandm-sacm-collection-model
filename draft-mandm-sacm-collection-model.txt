                  Endpoint Attribute Collection Model
                draft-mandm-sacm-collection-model-latest

Abstract

   This memo describes an information model (and associated data model)
   that can be used to encapsulate detailed endpoint attribute
   expressions for the purpose of performing collection of actual
   endpoint attributes in support of assessment.

1.  Introduction

   Collecting state information from endpoints of any classification is
   a challenging task without understanding the details of those
   endpoints.  In fact, this challenge represents one of the barriers to
   speeding policy to implementation in the enterprise - policy authors
   might know at an abstract level which endpoint attribute they'd like
   to collect, but they may not understand with enough detail how to
   express this in a machine readable form.

   This may be the result of so many different collection mechanisms.
   SSH, WinRM, PowerShell Remoting, SOAP-based services, NETCONF/
   RESTCONF, YANG Push, OVAL, basic command output capture, shell
   scripts, and the list probably goes on - the list may be as long as
   there are services on endpoints to query.  If we really want to get
   from policy to implementation quickly, the expression of collection
   must be reasonably decoupled from the machine readable expression of
   that collection.

   In this regard, we have expressed the notion of collection in its
   minimal form.  The balance of this document describes this minimal
   form in detail.  We begin with an information model and present
   initial XML and JSON bindings.

   [NOTE: We are not averse to other bindings being offered.]

2.  Terms and Definitions

   TBD

3.  Collection Expression Information Model

   [Overview of the entire IM]

3.1.  Objects

   [Descriptions of what an "object" is.  Seems to be a superset of
   endpoint attributes; or that "thing" from which we can extract
   attributes.]

3.2.  Filters

   [Description of why we need filters and what they are.  Include any
   implications, i.e. this may imply some degree of "evaluation" (for
   the purpose of filtering) wherever the collection process is
   executing.]

3.3.  Variables

   [Describe the variable hierarchy and what each means.  Dive into
   local variables and the different constructions present in that
   element.]

3.4.  Formal Information Model

   [Pull all of the above together into a concise information model in
   this subsection.]

4.  Collection Expression JSON Binding

   [Put forward a JSON binding for Collection Expression.]

5.  Collection Expression XML Binding

   [Convert the collection XML from the 102 hackathon (below) to a
   schema that binds to the previously described information model.]

6.  IANA Considerations

   [Whether there are IANA considerations remains TBD.  It may
   ultimately be that the decoupling of collection details from abstract
   collection instruction requires a registry for new collection
   details...]

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD

8.  Acknowledgements

9.  Change Log
